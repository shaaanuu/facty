# Facty ðŸŒ€

**"The universe is complicated. Facts? Not so much."**

Facty is your humble guide to the wonders of the worldâ€”one fact at a time. No fluff, no distractions. Just pure, unadulterated trivia, dished out like a cosmic wink.

## What Does It Do?

Facty is simple:

- You open it.
- It gives you a fact.
- You wonder, "How did I survive without this?"

## Why It Exists

Because sometimes life needs a pause, a chuckle, or a "Huh, thatâ€™s cool." And because coding is fun.

## Key Features

- **Facts in Your Face**: Smack dab in the middle of the screen, where they belong.
- **Minimalist Glory**: No menus, no clutter, no settingsâ€”because who has time for that?
- **Updated with Love**: Dust blown off, code polished, name fancied up.

## Instructions

1. Open Facty.
2. Absorb knowledge.
3. Question the universe.
4. Smile.

## Warning

May cause random outbursts of "Did you knowâ€¦?" among friends, family, and strangers. Use responsibly.
